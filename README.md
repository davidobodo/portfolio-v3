## Contribution

You can always leave a Pull request or raise an Issue, as that might be the best way for me to respond to any enquiry ðŸ¤”

## Final Words

Most likely with more knowledge I have now, would definitely implement a lot of things better and easier, however this was good for its time.

```
Just keep on learning and growing

Finally, do try not to copy every bit of the portfolio exactly as it is ðŸ˜…, `everyone is creative`, so I believe you can get some inspiration from here and then transform it into something unique for yourself.

Also, don't forget to star the repo if you think this is nice ðŸ˜‚
