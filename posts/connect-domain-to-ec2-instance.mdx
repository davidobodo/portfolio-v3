## Get a domain

First thing you need to do is to have a domain. Since that is not the focus of this article wouldn't de detaiing that here.

Would be using my own domain `davidobodo.com` which I got from [Namecheap]()

## Get a free SSL from AWS

## Create subdomain

Since we just got an ssl for a particular subdomain, we need to go to our domain provider to create that subdomain.

Our subdomain would point to the IP of our application.

From the previous tutotial, go and take the elastic ip that was created for our express our and use it to create an A NAME record in your domain provider

NEW RECORD:

- Type: A Record
- Host: aws-express-ec2
- Value: 52.0.219.117
- TTL: Automatic

Now within some time [http://aws-express-ec2.davidobodo.com/](http://aws-express-ec2.davidobodo.com/) would point to our express application

## Using our SSL so our app can be accessible over HTTPS

For this we would be setting up a load balancer. The load balancer would help reroute all traffic from http to https port
