1. Download mongodb community server
2. create directories to be used as the dbs
3. run this command to start the deamon on servers

```
mongod --port 2737 --dbpath ~/mongos/db3 --replSet sungloReplicaSet
```

4. Open another terminal for each and run

```
mongosh --port <PORT_NUMBER>
```

so we can run commands on the db

check status of replica set

```
rs.status()
```

initialize replica set

```
rs.initiate()
```

to clear screen

```
cls
```

to add members to the replica set

```
rs.add("IP OR PORT NUMBER")
```

to exit out of a shell

```
exit
```

to show databases

```
show dbs
```

to create or use a database

```
use <DATABASE_NAME>
```

If you can't read from the secondary node (although seems this command is deprecated)

```
rs.slaveOk()
```
