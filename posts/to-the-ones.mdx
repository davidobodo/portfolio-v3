## Happy New year (The year 2025)

Let me start by saying that you see, making it to a new year is just as big and exactly the same as you sleeping one day and waking up the next day ðŸ˜….

Anyways for some reason, the homo sapien specie decided that when the earth completes one rotation around the sun, we all should have a very big celebration.

Christians in church, Muslims in mosque (I think), Atheist wherever they go to.

People often go as far as having the intention to make a great change in their life because it's a new year.

Spoiler alert:

<Highlight>You do not have to wait for the start of a new year to make a positive change in your life</Highlight>

However, I can understand why we do decide to celebrate new years like this.

We as humans are always searching for purpose, a reason to do something, and well if we can't have a celebration like this in the transition between normal days, how about we make the transition that happens when the earth hits 360 degree around the sun special ? ðŸ¤”

Yeah it's all good, so:

In the spirit of reflection over the past year, I would like to talk about friendships and relationships.

So far so good, 2024 was my most outgoing year.

I went out like I have never done before,

I met new people like I have never met before and just had a lot of intentional human interaction.

You see, humans are what make everything worthwhile. If you were alone in the whole wide world, I bet after sometime you probably would get bored or something and kill yourself ðŸ˜‚

There are many movies that prove this concept, and movies asides it's just a fact that things and animals can never be compared to living breathing human beings.

Check out the movie [Passengers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355644/)

In light of that, would like to speak to the 3 categories of people/relationships I experienced in the year 2024:

## PEOPLE 1 - To the ones lost/drifting away

- Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear,
- Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near,
- Someday you'll say that word and I will cry,
- It'll break my heart to hear you say, "goodbye"

Aaaah that Celine Dion's song, so emotional ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜….

Goodbye is something I have never consciously said in my whole life. Asides from the few people I know who unfortunately have passed away, I have never had a friend or known someone who I
eventually at some point had to consciously say goodbye to and just drift apart until last year.

Just to be clear, when I say "lost/drifting away" I am not talking about the ones that death took from me, but the ones still alive yet our time has come to an end.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that this is not about romantic relationships, but about genuine true friendships.

<img src="/images/posts/to-the-ones/goodbye.gif" alt="New year" />

I would be lying if I said it's everyone who drifted away that I wanted to let happen ðŸ˜­.

However, sometimes life happens and situations and circumstances mean for both parties good, the distance has to occur.

Countless times I want to go back and I think this is natural.

Because, if a person is an integral part of your life, the moment they start drifting away, all your faculties would try to object and try to keep the connection.

Your brain is just trying to stay with what it is used to, and this happens to every new thing we experience in life.

With that said, I would like to talk about two types of drifting:

1. Intentional drifting
2. Unintentional drifting

#### Intentional drifting

These are the ones who I am glad we started having space, probably I even consciously engineered that space in order for us to go our seperate ways. ðŸ˜…

This mainly happened in cases where I knew I wasn't valued how I ought to be valued, or I intentionally wanted to just cut a communication.

I have long found out that people love it when they "think they are the ones who left you".

You can call it manipulative if you like, but sometimes when I know I want to detach from someone and I think this is the kind of person that likes the above, I can engineer the situation to make the person think they are the ones that decided to detach from me.

Nobody hurt at the end of the day, so I think it's all good ðŸ˜‚.

#### Unintentional drifting

Now these ones do hurt, cause most times we don't want it to happen.

However, we have to accept the fact that even though someone might be a priority to us, we might not be a priority to them.

Everyone is the master of his/her own life and they decide who is more valueable to them.

The fact that PersonA values PersonB, doesn't automatically mean that PersonB must value PersonA.

This is why there are some truths about life that one must attach to ones heart.

I once heard a statement about how to approach any type of relationship(i.e friendship, courtship e.t.c) for peace of mind. Many would have objections to it, but well life is diverse and it's ok for us to view the world through different lenses.

Here it is:

<Highlight>Give Energy, Observe Energy, Reciprocate Energy</Highlight>

I really love it because it brings self respect into play a lot when you consider it.

You need to know when someone doesn't want you in their life.

If you constantly give energy of 80 percent and someone always reciprocates it with an energy of 20 percent, Oh boy, it's time for you to also decrease that your energy to 20 percent, or better still just get out of the persons life, it ain't that hard. (ðŸ˜… actually it could be sometimes)

This giving and receiving of energy also links to another important truth that could lead to unintentional drifting. It is:

<Highlight>Don't go where they did not invite you</Highlight>

Like initially said, in a scenario where you give 80 percent, you might be of the illusion that oh you have the right to invite yourself.

But if you do settle down and think of the 20 percent you are constantly receiving, you would realize that you have no right to invite yourself and it's best to just stay put.

So here I am saying goodbye to the ones that drifted and are drifting away.

It was a good ride while we were close and I would always cherish whatever memories we did make.

For the memories and the experiences taught me and shaped me into what I am today, and my time with you has definitely no matter how fractionally small, had an impact in my life.

Finally, I would love to say that I have come to understand that the fact that I am not in someones life does not mean that I should wish them ill.

I wish them all the greatness they could possibly achieve in life even without me in their life.

So Adios.

## PEOPLE 2 - To the ones continued/here to stay

My lovelies, the ones that clearly are a part of my strength, cause if you are here it means we are aligned.

I do not have much to say to you, because clearly we have more experiences and memories to make together.

The story of our lives spent together is still being written in the sands of time.

We would run, jump, dream, do, cry, laugh, eat, forgive and experience life together and I sure do look forward to better experiences we would have.

So Let's go.

## PEOPLE 3 - To the ones yet to encounter

The ones who drifted away and the ones who stayed have setup a standard for the ones who I am yet to encounter.

Whether it be me who initiates the friendship or you, I can for sure say that it would be lovely.

Applying every single concept of mirroring energy, to mutually benefitial relationships and not the parasitic ones and just simply knowing that I can count on who I do meet and they on me.

I should not always want to go into isolation to regain myself when life hits me, for my choice of friends should also and would definitely play an important role in getting me up as life happens.

Friends who support dreams, friends who are positive, friends who are ready to try, friends who encourage, friends who are not stagnant, friends who would walk this life and triumph in it together.

ðŸ¤” `See the World`

Why do people say this statement a lot ?

I believe it is because only what the mind knows is possible can it accept.

If you never knew sky diving was a thing, you would never consider going sky diving.

If you never knew it was possible to earn a million dollars, you would never dream of earning a million dollars.

If you never knew non abusive relationship was a thing, you would always think all relationships are abusive.

If you never knew a healthy family with a loving mom and dad was a thing, you would always think that all homes are broken and it's impossible for there to be peace.

You might think a "bad" character your friend has is ok, until you actually do see people who exhibit the "good" character.

So do yourself a favour and see the world.

## Conclusion

As the sensei that I am, I have dropped some wisdom in this post ðŸ˜‚.

Finally would just add that you shouldn't make the mistake of not knowing where you stand in ones life, or overestimating your importance.

That's all the wisdom I have for now.

So

To the ones drifting away I say Adios,

To the ones here to stay I say Let's go, and Finally

To the ones yet to encounter, I say Cheers
