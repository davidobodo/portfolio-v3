ðŸ˜‚ Starting with a laugh cause who writes a year review one year late?

However it must be done so let's go.

## Releasing of Video Gamers Alliance(VGA)

I started the year wrapping up [Video Gamers Alliance(VGA)](https://beta-app.gamespeak.gg/) which is a splendid project designed for the Gamers community.

Working with [Ryan Chesnut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-chesnut/) and [Alexander Shuaibu](https://github.com/Xand6r) on this project was really fun and fulfilling.

I got to try, experiment and bring to live, features we all use in social media daily, and I loved the challenge. Far better than that, I am happy I surmounted every challenge that came.

You can find a more detailed post on about that on Linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-obodo_gamespeak-is-here-for-a-while-now-activity-7036690764466110464-1yxY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## The Job search

Since the "major" part time contract which was taking most of my time had come to an end, I knew it was time to go head on for a full time job. This time around I didn't want a part time contract role, because
I wanted something a lot more long term so the search was on.

Following my various research patterns, I decided to create a notion sheet where I could track all my Job applications. This sheet would contain, the name of the company, date I applied, status of application, e.t.c

I was going for a sweet balance of quality versus quantity in my Job search. That is, making enough research on the company I want to apply so that I do not submit a bland application, yet trying to hit at least 2 to 3 job applications within 2 days.

Qualification was not an issue for me, cause I had proven myself and my [portfolio](https://www.davidobodo.com) as well as [github profile](https://github.com/davidobodo) spoke for themselves, so it was majorly a battle of whether I was looking for a job that came with relocation or not. Also definitely a good pay and sweet working conditions ðŸ˜….

May I add that I had already started applying for Jobs since late 2022 at around September [see notion file](https://grizzly-tern-7eb.notion.site/Job-Applications-a68fbd1ee91b4255bc7ed32cd6c302db).

Now that is not even a complete list of all the companies I did apply to, as I wasn't always so diligent to update the document everytime.

I knew what I wanted so at that time I took around $200 from my account and subscribed to [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com/) cause I really did want my CV to be perfect. Well in my mind, I thought who can deny a stunning portfolio and a well advanced CV ?

Had a couple of sessions with them and CV came out good, however this wasn't still my final destination.

Then I came across [Kati Frantz](https://x.com/bahdcoder?lang=en). Sincerely, I have not heard such sound teaching about job application from anyone else like I did from Kati. Honestly I recommend that you check him out.

Of all the numerous things I learnt from him, it was his approach to clearly defining and explaining what a CV should contain.

<Highlight>Metrics , Numbers, Quantification are the super powers of a CV</Highlight>

Any achievement you have ever made needs to have some numbers, its the easiest way to pass across the message and this does not just apply to the tech industry. It applies to every industry

- A Musician stating the amount of records he sold
- A Pilot stating the amount of flying time recorded
- A surgeon also stating the amount of time spent in the operating room, or the amount of successful patients treated

The list goes on and on. Metrics make it a whole lot easier to gauge the impact of an activity.

Anyways that led me to getting quite a lot of interviews. However the funny thing is that it wasn't really my CV that got me my current job, but according to my current boss, it was my github profile activity ðŸ˜….

From the numerous platforms I applied for jobs through, I did get into my current role from [Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs).

I have loved every waking hour of being at [Redbrick AI](https://redbrickai.com/), cause the work life balance and work culture is just everything I hoped and prayed for.

## Coming to the end

Honestly speaking there is not much else I could say happened in the year, because after getting my Job I was focused on proving more of the value that I had already shown that I had.

This is definitely the reason, why I didn't have sometime for writing and other activities.

## This year 2024

2024 has been all about improving, growing, adding value to both myself, people around me and my Organization and I intend to keep doing so continually.

This article is coming extremely late ðŸ˜… (i.e December 2024, when it ought to be written January 2024), hence why I might not remember all the details.

Nevertheless a superb year at that

Adios.
