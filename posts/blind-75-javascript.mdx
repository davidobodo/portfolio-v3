## CHATGPT, How does this affect interviews?

Yeah yeah, I know what you are going to say ðŸ˜‚, CHATGPT this, CHATGPT that.

Yes, it is true that nowadayas we really do not need to take the extra effort like before to learn how to solve certain algorithm questions, cause CHATGPT can do that for us
and even give us some comprehensive explanation on the solution.

Since Data structures and algorithms was a vital part of a lot of company's interview process, what does this mean for Interview sessions that were mainly based on Data structure and Algorithms ?

I think it all depends on the company. Some have decided to reject it and prevent devs from using it during an interview, while others have embraced it, and allow it to be used during interviews.

Whatever the case one thing stands out. After solving a question, do you really understand why that solution worked?

If some parameters and constraints are changed, would you be able to alter the solution to suite the new constraints?

Can you solve the problem in psuedo code(i.e just explain the solution to someone without even writing code)?

Can you think of a better solution that would be better optimized?

In all these, just always remember that Artificial Intelligence (i.e CHATGPT in this case), is simply there to assist, and it's not every time it can answer all these questions accurately for you.

## Should I still learn Data structures and Algorithms?

I have thought about this question and also have been asked myself. Truth is that 80% of people learn Data structures and Algorithms because of
an interview, but to think that is the only reason to learn it would be greatly flawed.

Not matter how many programming languages exist or change the two things that would forever remain constant in the programming world are:

1. Time complexity - How fast is this going to execute ?
2. Space complexity - How much space is this execution going to take up ?

This is never going to change. If you build something small that is going to be used by very few people,
you might not necessarily need to take into account these two. But is you build something you expect to be big and used by millions of people
be rest assured that you need to take into account these.

At the heart of Data structures and algorithm, is learning how to manage both your time and space.

Take for example:

```tsx[class="line-numbers"]
const arrayIdStore = [
    {id: '111', name: 'first'},
    {id: '222', name: 'second'},
    {id: '333', name: 'third'},
    {id: '444', name: 'fourth'}
    {id: '555', name: 'fifth'}
]

const arrayObjectStore = {
    '111': {id: '111', name: 'first'},
    '222': {id: '222', name: 'second'},
    '333': {id: '333', name: 'third'},
    '444': {id: '444', name: 'fourth'}
    '555': {id: '555', name: 'fifth'}
}


```

## Blind 75, actually Blind 76

Data structures to an extent I believe are quite clear and you can see structured resources on how to learn them everywhere, however I don't think we can say the same thing for Algorithms
Day in day out, we see new algorithm questions being created, like how many LEETCODE, Hackerrank, Coding Game, e.t.c problems can you really solve ? and what is the best approach to take in your study?

Then comes BLIND 75, I think it should be BLIND 76 though
I don't know who made the list, but it sure has gained a lot of traction and after going through it, I see why. There is a certain level of progression about it and it covers most of the concepts one needs to really understand how to solve any question

While going through the list I mainly made use of these Youtube channels

First one, writes in PYTHON, while the other two write in Java. Nevertheless the explanation from these guys, OMG is too good, that I was always able to come up with the corresponsing Javascript solution of my own

So without further ado, here is a link to the repository
