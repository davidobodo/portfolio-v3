Amazed that it has taken me this long to reconsider writing.

Although the reason is not due to laziness or lack of will to do so, the reason is actually genuine and based on the fact that I have been swamped with work and delivering high value work in other areas of my life.

This has left me not to consider writing. However, I have now decided to take it up as priority for a couple of reasons:

1. Writing helps me think
2. Writing helps me teach, which in turn helps me understand better what is been taught
3. Writing helps me improve my vocabulary
4. Writing helps me imagine

<Highlight>Suffice it to say that writing is a major "propeller" ðŸ˜‚</Highlight>

I do not want to write just technical articles this time around, but also `life experiences`, `stories`, `life lessons` and what have you.

Probably if I had a youtube channel would tell the stories there, but I do not think I am quite ready for that at this moment.

I have a couple of drafts from the last time I was actively writing and I plan to wrap those up, cause they have really good information that you definitely need to read.

A school of thought says that writing and reading are siblings.

If one wants to write, then one must also read. But not necesarily though, or maybe. I am not the leading authority on the subject so it's ok to be wrong.

However, I am pretty sure that experiencing new things, going to places, meeting new people, interacting with something different, generally helps one write.

Basically having an adventure gives you something to talk about and in this case to write about. I guess that's why they say "Interests make you interesting". The more interests and the more you are involved in activities/experiences, the more things you have to talk about.

Anyways now I am rambling ðŸ˜‚. I have mentioned the main purpose of this article which is to start writing frequently, so its time to do so.
