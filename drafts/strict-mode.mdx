Applies to:

1. Entire scripts
2. Functions

By default strict mode is applied to modules

### What you can't do in strict mode

- Add properties to the global scope
- cannot use the name of a read only property e.g

```
 var Nan = 'david'

```

- Have duplicate function parameter names
- You cannot assign to non-writable properties, getter only property
