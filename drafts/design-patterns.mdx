## Singleton

CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN

Create only one instance to a class and provide only one global access point to that class

```js
class Logger {
	constructor() {
		if (Logger.instance === null) {
			this.logs = [];
			Logger.instance = true;
			return;
		}

		return Logger.instance;
	}

	log(message) {
		console.log(message);
		this.logs.push(message);
	}

	print() {
		console.log(this.logs.length);
	}
}

const logger = new Logger();
Object.freeze(logger); // So we can't add any new property
```

## Command

Data driven design pattern
