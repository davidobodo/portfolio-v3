Depends on how "this" is involked

Alone - Global
In object - Global
In function - Global
In function in strict mode - Undefined
In event
In callback

- OBJECT METHOD - object
- ALONE - global
- FUNCTION - global
- EVENT - element that received the event
- Passed as a callback - undefined
- arrow functions - the owner of the function i.e the enclosing lexical context

STRICT MODE

- FUNCTION - undefined

How the function is called
////////////////////////

Where wouls "this" ever exist

1. Alone

Never do this in your code, but if for come reason you do it, "this" would refer to the `global object`

2. Function

Actually it's inside a `function` or `method`, but well who are we kidding a `method` is just a function inside an object.

Now that we know it would always exist inside a function we can now proceed.

However we can either have a `regular function` or an `arrow function` so we need to consider the possibility of being in any of them

But then we Javascript can be run in both `strict` mode and `non-strict` mode so we have to consider that

Now unto the cases:

#### Exposed endpoint:

| Endpoint                     | Regular Function                        | Arrow Function |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| GET `/user/:userId`          | Strict                                  | Non Stict      | sdjskdjs |
| GET `/user/social/:userId`   | Fetches a user social media details     |
| PATCH `/user/update/:userId` | Updates user given the user id as param |
