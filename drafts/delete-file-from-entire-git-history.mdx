If file was `.env`

- STEP 1: Add file to gitignore

```
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
```

- STEP 2: Run this command
  Replace `.env` with whatever file it is

```
git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD
```

- STEP 3: Force Push

```
git push --force
```

NOTE: If you only just want to remove the file but don't care about removing it from git history just run

```
git rm -r --cached .env
```
