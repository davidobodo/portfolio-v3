## void

absence of having any type at all
most commonly used as the return type of a function that does not return a value

## never

only type never can be assigned to itself
UseCase

- to force our hand to handle all cases

```typescript

```

A function returning `never` cannot have a reachable end pointx
A function returning `never` cannot ever reach the end of the function i.e the second parenthesis `}`

- Using `never` to do one or the other

## Unknown

Anything is assignable to `unknown`
`unknown` is not assignable to anything except `any` and `unknown`

To make sure that we have hit all cases

Instead of using `any`, use `unknown` then use type checks before performing any action

## Alias

assigning a type to a name instead of repeating it everytime e.g

```
type TLogin = {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
```
