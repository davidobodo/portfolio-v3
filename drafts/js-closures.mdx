The reason for all this is because we want to use something multiple times and we dont want to repeat ourselves
We want to pass a parameter into a function without invoking it

When a function finishes executing, it is removed from the call stack, all its variables and stuffs defined in it are no longer available

## Lexical scope

- is an important part of closure but its not in itself closure
- defines how variables are resolved in nested functions

## closure

a closure is created when we define a function, not when the function is executed
