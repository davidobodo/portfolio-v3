		<p><span>Ozidi</span> which later became <span>Agricpay</span>, was a promising startup which had a vision to <a>help small-scale farmers in "Nigeria" get access to loans.</a> It is of no news that in order for 
		any business to request for loans from banks and other loan agencies, the owner must have some form of <span>collateral to give</span> should in case the individual is not able to pay the loan. Unfortunately most smale scale farmers 
		do not have any collateral to give, hence the need for Agricpay.
		</p>
		<p>
		Agricpay aimed at solving this problem, by inculcating in the farmers mindset the <span>habit of saving</span>. Using this approach meant in the long run the farmer would be borrowing his/her own money
		</p>

		<p>I worked as the <span>"main" frontend developer responsible for the entire ui/ux as well as about 80% of the entire frontend </span> , together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/godinson/" target="_blank">Joseph Godwin (full stack developer)</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwaferanmiadetunji/" target="_blank">Adetunji Oluwaferanmi (full stack developer)</a>, at the <a href="https://www.enye.tech/" target="_blank">Enye Cohort 4 internship</a>, we set out to build a

		<div>
			<p>Some of the features included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>- Admin authentication</li>
				<li>- Ability to generate recharge card numbers. (i.e Farmers save by buying reacharge cards)</li>
				<li>- History of all recharge cards generated</li>
				<li>- Farmers data</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Unfortunately, not all startups reach the "promise land" irrespective of a solid technology, because there are more things asides from the tech involved in the success of a business. So the live links are currently down, however for curiousity sake
